# Map File Parser GUI


This is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with `customtkinter` to parse `.map` files typically generated by compilers and linkers. It extracts a list of global variables and their corresponding memory addresses, allowing you to export this information into several useful formats to use for SW Integration Testing.

## Features

- **Simple GUI:** An intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **MAP File Parsing:** Efficiently reads a `.map` file and extracts variable names and their hexadecimal addresses.
- **Multiple Export Formats:** Save the extracted data in one of three formats:
  - **Text File (.txt):** A simple key-value list.
  - **Python File (.py):** A generated Python class with variables as instance attributes.
  - **Excel File (.xlsx):** A properly formatted spreadsheet with auto-sized columns for readability.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries: `customtkinter`, `CTkMessagebox`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andreitoma59/map_file_parser_gui.git
    cd map_file_parser_gui
    ```

2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install customtkinter CTkMessagebox pandas openpyxl
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the application** from the root directory of the project:
    ```bash
    python src/map_file_parser_final.py
    ```

2.  Click the **Browse Map File** button to open a file dialog and select your `.map` file.
    
3.  Select the desired output format using the radio buttons: **Text File**, **Python File**, or **Excel File**.

4.  Click the **Go** button.

5.  The application will parse the file and save the output in the same directory as the source `.map` file. A success message will confirm the path of the newly created file (e.g., `your_map_file_variables.txt`).

## Output Examples

### Text File (`_variables.txt`)
A simple text file with each variable and its address on a new line.
```
SOME_VARIABLE_NAME: 0x20000abc
ANOTHER_VARIABLE:   0x20000ac0
```

### Python File (`_variables.py`)
A Python class where each variable is an attribute, making it easy to import and use in other scripts.
```python
class MapVariables:
    def __init__(self):
        self.SOME_VARIABLE_NAME = '0x20000abc'
        self.ANOTHER_VARIABLE = '0x20000ac0'
```

### Excel File (`_variables.xlsx`)
An Excel spreadsheet with two columns, "Variable Name" and "Hexadecimal Value", with column widths automatically adjusted for full visibility.
